# Nino residual PPO package

For the expanded rough terrain, use the [evaluation-gated route curriculum,
terrain variants and Laya guide](../../docs/ROUGH_ROUTE_CURRICULUM.md).
The supervisor script starts E1 first, retains earlier routes while adding
goal groups, then introduces R1–R3 terrain variation between blocks.

The current implementation uses a 300-value observation history and three
continuous actions: straight-reference speed scale, common torque residual and
differential torque residual. Nav2 is disabled: the baseline is a direct forward
command with zero angular velocity. The robot has passive caster supports; it is not a two-wheel
inverted pendulum. CUDA training is the default.

1. Follow [the complete root README](../../README.md) from Ubuntu/driver setup
   through ROS/Gazebo, the Python venv, build, preflight and training.
2. Read [RL_IMPROVEMENTS.md](RL_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for the exact active reward,
   policy, engineering decisions and trajectory metrics.
3. Use `evaluate_baseline` and `evaluate` sequentially with matching phase,
   configuration and seeds. Each exports `trajectory.csv`, actual/reference CSVs and automatic
   path RMSE, P95, heading, completion, comfort and timing scores, plus an
   expected-versus-robot trajectory plot for every episode.
4. Use `trajectory_metrics` for custom geometric or timestamped references and
   `compare_evaluations` for compatible baseline/PPO summaries.

Training contract revision 24 requires a fresh run after this patch. Later phase
changes can resume revision-24 checkpoints. The older `ALGORITHM_V2.md` and
`REWARD_POLICY_UPDATE.md` describe historical revisions; current defaults and
commands are in the root README and RL_IMPROVEMENTS.md.

## Completed training bundle

[Weights, measured training results and integration commands](models/completed_train/README.md)
are included in this package. After rebuilding, `ros2 run nino_rl policy_node`
loads the bundled checkpoint and matching configuration on CPU by default.
